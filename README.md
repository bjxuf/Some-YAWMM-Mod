# Some-YAWMM-Mod
Based on YAWMM which itself is based on WAD Manager, modded up by various people.  
Changes from the last YAWMM googlecode version:  
-updated to be compiled in the latest devkitppc, libogc versions  
-added on-the-fly IOS patches when AHBPROT is disabled, so no cIOS is required in those cases  
-support for classic controller, wiiu pro controller (on both wii and vwii) and wiiu gamepad (in wii vc mode)  
-small corrections in how the root path is selected (having no "wad" folder now correctly displays on device root)    

For more info on YAWMM itself, check its [original readme](README_YAWMM.txt).
